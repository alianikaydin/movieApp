# Movie Application
* This application show users to movies in a 3 different category (Now playing, Top rated, Upcoming). Users can add the movies to favourites list and see them in the fourth tab. In order to use this project, clone the repository and open folder "MovieApplication" with Android Studio
* I have developed this application using clean architecture with MVP strategy. 
* I have used dependency injection as design pattern and used dagger2 to ensure the dependency injection
* If I have more time, I can optimize my code to reduce data usage, improve my UI design and change my design to MVVM to use Android pagination library.
* There should be user authentication to hold the data on a cloud. Also the number of provided features can be increased such as recommandatio feature.
* You should install Android Studio to run this code.
